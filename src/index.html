		<h2>The Problem</h2>
		<p>Beneath the flashy homepages of your favorite sites lurk Hooli™ and other evil corporations out to hoard and sell
			your most personal data.</p>
		<p>What was built to be the ultimate platform for the free sharing of knowledge has turned into a money-hungry
			monster feasting on our privacy and freedom.</p>
		<p>But fear not, for Pied Piper has the answer! And it’s simple: An autonomous peer-to-peer network featuring
			distributed storage powered by universal compression, accelerated scheduling allocation, and end-to-end
			encryption.</p>
		<p>Put even simpler — it’s the internet, completely decentralized.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<p>We’re in this together! All of our computers and phones join in a network to make the strongest supercomputer the
			world has ever seen.</p>

		<h2>Introducing PiedPiperCoin</h2>

			that power our entire decentralized web.</p>
		<p> Now there's a way to give credit where credit is due. Compute credit, that is! The more you share your device
			resources, the more PiedPiperCoin you receive.</p>
		<p>Whether you're a developer with an app ready for market, or just an Average Joe with a smartphone you'll love all
			you can do with PiedPiperCoin.</p>
